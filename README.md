# chessPGNtoParquet
This is short code with functions to merge many PGN files, here from chess.com and to convert PGN to csv and parquet for better analysis.
I used libraries: pandas, chess, pyarrow and csv.
PGN chess data can be useful for analysis of games and openings. Depends on purpose more useful can be parquet or csv data. 
In this example there are not ECO data, I think I need to have premium account for it. Maybe next time...
